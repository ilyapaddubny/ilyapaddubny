* **Leadership Experience:** I served as team leader on this project, managing 3 developers and utilizing GitHub project boards to track progress and coordinate efforts. Notably, I delegated features among the team members and successfully resolved any merge conflicts that arose, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process. This resulted in the successful presentation of the final project.

* **Challenges Overcome:** Successfully met a tight two-week deadline while adhering to design guidelines.
